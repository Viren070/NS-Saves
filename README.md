# NX-Saves

A collection of saves for the nintendo switch. I do not own or have any relation with these saves. They were taken from Ecchibitionist's Archive. Each save file has the creator of the save in the file name (if they wanted to be credited). This is used by my [Emulator Manager](https://github.com/Viren070/Emulator-Manager)

If you want to contribute a save file, create a pull request.
